# TODO

- TemplateParser type with caching
- Change the Methodhandler to only be an inteface. Add a proxyHandler. The current method handler should be a MethodHandler implementation
- Split listen address to host and port (-h and -p)
- Set service as a flag

## Maybe?

- A "Response" type, containing multiple condition-response pairs that are checked
